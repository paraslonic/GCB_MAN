This server contains precaluclated data for 143 prokaryote species. Complete list of species and strains can be found here.
Tutorials and documentation can be found on RTFM.

Standalone version is available to analize custom genome set, it consists of command-line tools and stand-alone browser based application.
Tutorials and documentation will be needed to operate GCB and can be found on RTFM.

Google group is available to ask questions.
