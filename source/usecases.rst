Determine context and variants of operon of interest 
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider we are interested in a particular operon and want to know more about its representation in a particular group of organisms. Let's take `lactose operon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac_operon>`_ with its regulator in the Escherichia coli as an example (we will call it lac operon further).

First we need to determine genome position of genes of interest. We can do it in multiple ways, i.e. from `EcoCyc <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type%3DOPERON%26object%3DTU00036&sa=D&ust=1585816672295000>`_ database or from `NCBI Refseq <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000913.3>`_. In our case, according to BioCyc, genome region of interst is located at 361249-366305 in *K-12 substr. MG1655*. First we select Escherichia coli as ``Organism`` in a dataset containing 300 *E. coli* genomes. Then we select K-12 MG1655 as ``Reference``. Only one contig is present (finished genome, no plasmids), so we do not need to change ``Contig`` value.

Then we should put the operon's margin coordinates to text fields: ``Start coordinate`` and ``End coordinate``.

        :scale: 80 %

Now we click ``Draw`` button on the bottom panel and graph representation of the operon appears. 

.. image:: img/tutorial/use1/use1_3.png

We can see that edges are of different colors: black and red. Red colored are edges which are in agreement with the reference genome, i.e. they represent the gene order of reference genome. All other edges are black, they correspond to genes neighbourhood variants not present in a reference genome. Nodes of genes which present in a reference genome are colored pink, nodes for genes absent in a reference genome are colored green. Gray rectangle is drawn around nodes located between ``Start coordinate`` and ``End coordinate`` (lac operon genes in our case), other nodes are added to show the context. 

More clear layout can be obtained manually by left clicking and dragging nodes with mouse.

We can see now that operon is located in a conservative context in most of the genomes (thick edges designated with 1 and 2).
We may notice that one of the operonâ€™s genes is absent in some set of genomes. By left clicking on that gene we can examine its gene product. Gene products are assigned with `prokka <https://github.com/tseemann/prokka>`__ tool in the web version of GCB. Text in popup box is formated as ```product: length (position)``` (length in nucleotides, position is reported only for genes present in refernce genome).

In our case it is Galactoside acetyltransferase which is missing from the operon in some set of genomes. What are that genomes? By clicking on the bypassing edge we can select it. Selection of the edge results in two effects: 1) names of genomes corresponding to this edge (those genomes in which linked by the edge genes are located next to each other) appears in a ``List of genomes`` section below the graph, 2) other edges containing at least one of the genomes corresponding to the selected edge are colored blue. In this way, we can determine what possible variants of gene content and gene order are present, and in which genomes. 

.. image:: img/tutorial/use1/select_edge.gif

For now we have determined that a number of genomes does not contain Galactoside acetyltransferase (we can copy-paste their names and calculate the total number, 29 in this case). We can also notice nodes connected by a thin edges which seems to represent other alternative variants of the operon. Let's click on them and on nodes from reference to see their products.

In this case we see that their names are the same, but their length differ a lot: 263 b.p. for an outlier gene and 1253 b.p. for a reference gene. Often, and also in this particular case,  it comes from frameshit splitting some genes into parts, some of which may become part of homology groups representing original gene.

Finaly to verify our findings let's switch to paralogues orthologization mode. To do it you should toggle ``Draw paralogous`` switcher on the top panel and click ``Draw`` button once more (be careful, your current graph layout will be lost, so consider opening new page). After clicking and dragging nodes it should be looking like this. A little bit scary.

This more complicated graph comes from not ignoring paralogous genes as it done by default, but instead showing all of them.


Our analysis was not quick and simple, its more like exploration than gaining quick answers. And like web browser gives opportunity to surfe the internet, our browser allows surfing genomes.
